The Account_creation folder contains 3 files, account_creation.py, password_handler.py, and sql_commands.py. account_creation.py is a python file that is contains the flask code, and is importing the two other files to use. It contains one route called account_creation, and its function called create. The function can recieve GET and POST commands and checks between the two. If it receives a Get command it will load in the account creation html template. If it receives a POST template it will grab the username and password given to by the user, and then run functions if the username and password is valid. If not it will give feedback on what mistake the user has done. If an account is created successfully then it will send the user to the login page where the user will be prompted to log in. The password_handler.py contains the password_checker function which goes through all the specifications that the password must have in order for it to be a valid password. The sql_commands.py file contains two functions, the first being insert_username_and_password() function, which will just insert the username and password into the database. The second function is the check_for_username function that will check the username and return true if there is no username in the database and false is there already exists a username in the database.
